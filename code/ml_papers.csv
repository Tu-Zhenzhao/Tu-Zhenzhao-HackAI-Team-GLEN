"Agents in Software Engineering: Survey, Landscape, and Vision","In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
success and have been widely used in various downstream tasks, especially in
the tasks of the software engineering (SE) field. We find that many studies
combining LLMs with SE have employed the concept of agents either explicitly or
implicitly. However, there is a lack of an in-depth survey to sort out the
development context of existing works, analyze how existing works combine the
LLM-based agent technologies to optimize various tasks, and clarify the
framework of LLM-based agents in SE. In this paper, we conduct the first survey
of the studies on combining LLM-based agents with SE and present a framework of
LLM-based agents in SE which includes three key modules: perception, memory,
and action. We also summarize the current challenges in combining the two
fields and propose future opportunities in response to existing challenges. We
maintain a GitHub repository of the related papers at:

Learning Theory Informed Priors for Bayesian Inference: A Case Study with Early Dark Energy,"Cosmological models are often motivated and formulated in the language of
particle physics, using quantities such as the axion decay constant, but tested
against data using ostensibly physical quantities, such as energy density
ratios, assuming uniform priors on the latter. This approach neglects priors on
the model from fundamental theory, including from particle physics and string
theory, such as the preference for sub-Planckian axion decay constants. We
introduce a novel approach to learning theory-informed priors for Bayesian
inference using normalizing flows (NF), a flexible generative machine learning
technique that generates priors on model parameters when analytic expressions
are unavailable or difficult to compute. As a test case, we focus on early dark
energy (EDE), a model designed to address the Hubble tension. Rather than using
uniform priors on the $\textit{phenomenological}$ EDE parameters $f_{\rm EDE}$
and $z_c$, we train a NF on EDE cosmologies informed by theory expectations for
axion masses and decay constants. Our method recovers known constraints in this
representation while being $\sim 300,000$ times more efficient in terms of
total CPU compute time. Applying our NF to $\textit{Planck}$ and BOSS data, we
obtain the first theory-informed constraints on EDE, finding $f_{\rm EDE}
\lesssim 0.02$ at $95\%$ confidence with an $H_0$ consistent with
$\textit{Planck}$, but in $\sim 6\sigma$ tension with SH0ES. This yields the
strongest constraints on EDE to date, additionally challenging its role in
resolving the Hubble tension.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09029v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09029v1
Towards Leveraging Contrastively Pretrained Neural Audio Embeddings for Recommender Tasks,"Music recommender systems frequently utilize network-based models to capture
relationships between music pieces, artists, and users. Although these
relationships provide valuable insights for predictions, new music pieces or
artists often face the cold-start problem due to insufficient initial
information. To address this, one can extract content-based information
directly from the music to enhance collaborative-filtering-based methods. While
previous approaches have relied on hand-crafted audio features for this
purpose, we explore the use of contrastively pretrained neural audio embedding
models, which offer a richer and more nuanced representation of music. Our
experiments demonstrate that neural embeddings, particularly those generated
with the Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) model, present a
promising approach to enhancing music recommendation tasks within graph-based
frameworks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09026v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09026v1
INN-PAR: Invertible Neural Network for PPG to ABP Reconstruction,"Non-invasive and continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring is essential for
the early prevention of many cardiovascular diseases. Estimating arterial blood
pressure (ABP) from photoplethysmography (PPG) has emerged as a promising
solution. However, existing deep learning approaches for PPG-to-ABP
reconstruction (PAR) encounter certain information loss, impacting the
precision of the reconstructed signal. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce an invertible neural network for PPG to ABP reconstruction (INN-PAR),
which employs a series of invertible blocks to jointly learn the mapping
between PPG and its gradient with the ABP signal and its gradient. INN-PAR
efficiently captures both forward and inverse mappings simultaneously, thereby
preventing information loss. By integrating signal gradients into the learning
process, INN-PAR enhances the network's ability to capture essential
high-frequency details, leading to more accurate signal reconstruction.
Moreover, we propose a multi-scale convolution module (MSCM) within the
invertible block, enabling the model to learn features across multiple scales
effectively. We have experimented on two benchmark datasets, which show that
INN-PAR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both waveform
reconstruction and BP measurement accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09021v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09021v1
An Efficient and Streaming Audio Visual Active Speaker Detection System,"This paper delves into the challenging task of Active Speaker Detection
(ASD), where the system needs to determine in real-time whether a person is
speaking or not in a series of video frames. While previous works have made
significant strides in improving network architectures and learning effective
representations for ASD, a critical gap exists in the exploration of real-time
system deployment. Existing models often suffer from high latency and memory
usage, rendering them impractical for immediate applications. To bridge this
gap, we present two scenarios that address the key challenges posed by
real-time constraints. First, we introduce a method to limit the number of
future context frames utilized by the ASD model. By doing so, we alleviate the
need for processing the entire sequence of future frames before a decision is
made, significantly reducing latency. Second, we propose a more stringent
constraint that limits the total number of past frames the model can access
during inference. This tackles the persistent memory issues associated with
running streaming ASD systems. Beyond these theoretical frameworks, we conduct
extensive experiments to validate our approach. Our results demonstrate that
constrained transformer models can achieve performance comparable to or even
better than state-of-the-art recurrent models, such as uni-directional GRUs,
with a significantly reduced number of context frames. Moreover, we shed light
on the temporal memory requirements of ASD systems, revealing that larger past
context has a more profound impact on accuracy than future context. When
profiling on a CPU we find that our efficient architecture is memory bound by
the amount of past context it can use and that the compute cost is negligible
as compared to the memory cost.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09018v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09018v1
Closed-Loop Visuomotor Control with Generative Expectation for Robotic Manipulation,"Despite significant progress in robotics and embodied AI in recent years,
deploying robots for long-horizon tasks remains a great challenge. Majority of
prior arts adhere to an open-loop philosophy and lack real-time feedback,
leading to error accumulation and undesirable robustness. A handful of
approaches have endeavored to establish feedback mechanisms leveraging
pixel-level differences or pre-trained visual representations, yet their
efficacy and adaptability have been found to be constrained. Inspired by
classic closed-loop control systems, we propose CLOVER, a closed-loop
visuomotor control framework that incorporates feedback mechanisms to improve
adaptive robotic control. CLOVER consists of a text-conditioned video diffusion
model for generating visual plans as reference inputs, a measurable embedding
space for accurate error quantification, and a feedback-driven controller that
refines actions from feedback and initiates replans as needed. Our framework
exhibits notable advancement in real-world robotic tasks and achieves
state-of-the-art on CALVIN benchmark, improving by 8% over previous open-loop
counterparts. Code and checkpoints are maintained at
https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/CLOVER.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09016v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09016v1
AI-LieDar: Examine the Trade-off Between Utility and Truthfulness in LLM Agents,"To be safely and successfully deployed, LLMs must simultaneously satisfy
truthfulness and utility goals. Yet, often these two goals compete (e.g., an AI
agent assisting a used car salesman selling a car with flaws), partly due to
ambiguous or misleading user instructions. We propose AI-LieDar, a framework to
study how LLM-based agents navigate scenarios with utility-truthfulness
conflicts in a multi-turn interactive setting. We design a set of realistic
scenarios where language agents are instructed to achieve goals that are in
conflict with being truthful during a multi-turn conversation with simulated
human agents. To evaluate the truthfulness at large scale, we develop a
truthfulness detector inspired by psychological literature to assess the
agents' responses. Our experiment demonstrates that all models are truthful
less than 50% of the time, although truthfulness and goal achievement (utility)
rates vary across models. We further test the steerability of LLMs towards
truthfulness, finding that models follow malicious instructions to deceive, and
even truth-steered models can still lie. These findings reveal the complex
nature of truthfulness in LLMs and underscore the importance of further
research to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of LLMs and AI agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09013v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09013v1
VAE Explainer: Supplement Learning Variational Autoencoders with Interactive Visualization,"Variational Autoencoders are widespread in Machine Learning, but are
typically explained with dense math notation or static code examples. This
paper presents VAE Explainer, an interactive Variational Autoencoder running in
the browser to supplement existing static documentation (e.g., Keras Code
Examples). VAE Explainer adds interactions to the VAE summary with interactive
model inputs, latent space, and output. VAE Explainer connects the high-level
understanding with the implementation: annotated code and a live computational
graph. The VAE Explainer interactive visualization is live at
https://xnought.github.io/vae-explainer and the code is open source at

Contri(e)ve: Context + Retrieve for Scholarly Question Answering,"Scholarly communication is a rapid growing field containing a wealth of
knowledge. However, due to its unstructured and document format, it is
challenging to extract useful information from them through conventional
document retrieval methods. Scholarly knowledge graphs solve this problem, by
representing the documents in a semantic network, providing, hidden insights,
summaries and ease of accessibility through queries. Naturally, question
answering for scholarly graphs expands the accessibility to a wider audience.
But some of the knowledge in this domain is still presented as unstructured
text, thus requiring a hybrid solution for question answering systems. In this
paper, we present a two step solution using open source Large Language
Model(LLM): Llama3.1 for Scholarly-QALD dataset. Firstly, we extract the
context pertaining to the question from different structured and unstructured
data sources: DBLP, SemOpenAlex knowledge graphs and Wikipedia text. Secondly,
we implement prompt engineering to improve the information retrieval
performance of the LLM. Our approach achieved an F1 score of 40% and also
observed some anomalous responses from the LLM, that are discussed in the final
part of the paper.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09010v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09010v1
Optimizing Rare Word Accuracy in Direct Speech Translation with a Retrieval-and-Demonstration Approach,"Direct speech translation (ST) models often struggle with rare words.
Incorrect translation of these words can have severe consequences, impacting
translation quality and user trust. While rare word translation is inherently
challenging for neural models due to sparse learning signals, real-world
scenarios often allow access to translations of past recordings on similar
topics. To leverage these valuable resources, we propose a
retrieval-and-demonstration approach to enhance rare word translation accuracy
in direct ST models. First, we adapt existing ST models to incorporate
retrieved examples for rare word translation, which allows the model to benefit
from prepended examples, similar to in-context learning. We then develop a
cross-modal (speech-to-speech, speech-to-text, text-to-text) retriever to
locate suitable examples. We demonstrate that standard ST models can be
effectively adapted to leverage examples for rare word translation, improving
rare word translation accuracy over the baseline by 17.6% with gold examples
and 8.5% with retrieved examples. Moreover, our speech-to-speech retrieval
approach outperforms other modalities and exhibits higher robustness to unseen
speakers. Our code is publicly available
(https://github.com/SiqiLii/Retrieve-and-Demonstration-ST).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09009v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09009v1
Chiral dark matter and radiative neutrino masses from gauged U(1) symmetry,"We propose a class of dark matter models based on a chiral $U(1)$ gauge
symmetry acting on a dark sector. The chiral $U(1)$ protects the masses of the
dark sector fermions, and also guarantees the stability of the dark matter
particle by virtue of an unbroken discrete $\mathcal{Z}_N$ gauge symmetry. We
identify 38 such $U(1)$ models which are descendants of a chiral $SU(3) \times
SU(2)$ gauge symmetry, consisting of a minimal set of fermions with simple
$U(1)$ charge assignments. We show how these models can also be utilized to
generate small Majorana neutrino masses radiatively via the scotogenic
mechanism with the dark sector particles circulating inside loop diagrams. We
further explore the phenomenology of the simplest model in this class, which
admits a Majorana fermion, Dirac fermion or a scalar field to be the dark
matter candidate, and show the consistency of various scenarios with
constraints from relic density and direct detection experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09008v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09008v1
SGFormer: Single-Layer Graph Transformers with Approximation-Free Linear Complexity,"Learning representations on large graphs is a long-standing challenge due to
the inter-dependence nature. Transformers recently have shown promising
performance on small graphs thanks to its global attention for capturing
all-pair interactions beyond observed structures. Existing approaches tend to
inherit the spirit of Transformers in language and vision tasks, and embrace
complicated architectures by stacking deep attention-based propagation layers.
In this paper, we attempt to evaluate the necessity of adopting multi-layer
attentions in Transformers on graphs, which considerably restricts the
efficiency. Specifically, we analyze a generic hybrid propagation layer,
comprised of all-pair attention and graph-based propagation, and show that
multi-layer propagation can be reduced to one-layer propagation, with the same
capability for representation learning. It suggests a new technical path for
building powerful and efficient Transformers on graphs, particularly through
simplifying model architectures without sacrificing expressiveness. As
exemplified by this work, we propose a Simplified Single-layer Graph
Transformers (SGFormer), whose main component is a single-layer global
attention that scales linearly w.r.t. graph sizes and requires none of any
approximation for accommodating all-pair interactions. Empirically, SGFormer
successfully scales to the web-scale graph ogbn-papers100M, yielding
orders-of-magnitude inference acceleration over peer Transformers on
medium-sized graphs, and demonstrates competitiveness with limited labeled
data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09007v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09007v1
Model-independent variable selection via the rule-based variable priority,"While achieving high prediction accuracy is a fundamental goal in machine
learning, an equally important task is finding a small number of features with
high explanatory power. One popular selection technique is permutation
importance, which assesses a variable's impact by measuring the change in
prediction error after permuting the variable. However, this can be problematic
due to the need to create artificial data, a problem shared by other methods as
well. Another problem is that variable selection methods can be limited by
being model-specific. We introduce a new model-independent approach, Variable
Priority (VarPro), which works by utilizing rules without the need to generate
artificial data or evaluate prediction error. The method is relatively easy to
use, requiring only the calculation of sample averages of simple statistics,
and can be applied to many data settings, including regression, classification,
and survival. We investigate the asymptotic properties of VarPro and show,
among other things, that VarPro has a consistent filtering property for noise
variables. Empirical studies using synthetic and real-world data show the
method achieves a balanced performance and compares favorably to many
state-of-the-art procedures currently used for variable selection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09003v2,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09003v2
"E2MoCase: A Dataset for Emotional, Event and Moral Observations in News Articles on High-impact Legal Cases","The way media reports on legal cases can significantly shape public opinion,
often embedding subtle biases that influence societal views on justice and
morality. Analyzing these biases requires a holistic approach that captures the
emotional tone, moral framing, and specific events within the narratives. In
this work we introduce E2MoCase, a novel dataset designed to facilitate the
integrated analysis of emotions, moral values, and events within legal
narratives and media coverage. By leveraging advanced models for emotion
detection, moral value identification, and event extraction, E2MoCase offers a
multi-dimensional perspective on how legal cases are portrayed in news
articles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09001v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09001v1
Dark Matter Axion Search with HAYSTAC Phase II,"This Letter reports new results from the HAYSTAC experiment's search for dark
matter axions in our galactic halo. It represents the widest search to date
that utilizes squeezing to realize sub-quantum limited noise. The new results
cover 1.71 $\mu$eV of newly scanned parameter space in the mass ranges
17.28--18.44 $\mu$eV and 18.71--19.46 $\mu$eV. No statistically significant
evidence of an axion signal was observed, excluding couplings $|g_\gamma|\geq$
2.75$\times$$|g_{\gamma}^{\text{KSVZ}}|$ and $|g_\gamma|\geq$
2.96$\times$$|g_{\gamma}^{\text{KSVZ}}|$ at the 90$\%$ confidence level over
the respective region. By combining this data with previously published results
using HAYSTAC's squeezed state receiver, a total of 2.27 $\mu$eV of parameter
space has now been scanned between 16.96--19.46 $\mu$eV, excluding
$|g_\gamma|\geq$ 2.86$\times$$|g_{\gamma}^{\text{KSVZ}}|$ at the 90$\%$
confidence level. These results demonstrate the squeezed state receiver's
ability to probe axion models over a significant mass range while achieving a
scan rate enhancement relative to a quantum-limited experiment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08998v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08998v1
Biomimetic Frontend for Differentiable Audio Processing,"While models in audio and speech processing are becoming deeper and more
end-to-end, they as a consequence need expensive training on large data, and
are often brittle. We build on a classical model of human hearing and make it
differentiable, so that we can combine traditional explainable biomimetic
signal processing approaches with deep-learning frameworks. This allows us to
arrive at an expressive and explainable model that is easily trained on modest
amounts of data. We apply this model to audio processing tasks, including
classification and enhancement. Results show that our differentiable model
surpasses black-box approaches in terms of computational efficiency and
robustness, even with little training data. We also discuss other potential
applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08997v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08997v1
Diffusion crossover from/to $q$-statistics to/from Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics in the classical inertial $α$-XY ferromagnet,"We study the angular diffusion in a classical $d-$dimensional inertial XY
model with interactions decaying with the distance between spins as
$r^{-\alpha}$, wiht $\alpha\geqslant 0$. After a very short-time ballistic
regime, with $\sigma_\theta^2\sim t^2$, a super-diffusive regime, for which
$\sigma_\theta^2\sim t^{\alpha_D}$, with $\alpha_D \simeq 1\text{.}45$ is
observed, whose duration covers an initial quasistationary state and its
transition to a second plateau characterized by the Boltzmann-Gibbs temperature
$T_\text{BG}$. Long after $T_\text{BG}$ is reached, a crossover to normal
diffusion, $\sigma_\theta^2\sim t$, is observed. We relate, for the first time,
via the expression $\alpha_D = 2/(3 - q)$, the anomalous diffusion exponent
$\alpha_D$ with the entropic index $q$ characterizing the time-averaged angles
and momenta probability distribution functions (pdfs), which are given by the
so called $q-$Gaussian distributions, $f_q(x)\propto e_q(-\beta x^2)$, where
$e_q (u) \equiv [1 + (1 - q)u]^{\frac{1}{1 - q}}$ ($e_1(u) = \exp(u)$). For
fixed size $N$ and large enough times, the index $q_\theta$ characterizing the
angles pdf approaches unity, thus indicating a final relaxation to
Boltzmann-Gibbs equilibrium. For fixed time and large enough $N$, the crossover
occurs in the opposite sense.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08992v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08992v1
Comparative Analysis of Pretrained Audio Representations in Music Recommender Systems,"Over the years, Music Information Retrieval (MIR) has proposed various models
pretrained on large amounts of music data. Transfer learning showcases the
proven effectiveness of pretrained backend models with a broad spectrum of
downstream tasks, including auto-tagging and genre classification. However, MIR
papers generally do not explore the efficiency of pretrained models for Music
Recommender Systems (MRS). In addition, the Recommender Systems community tends
to favour traditional end-to-end neural network learning over these models. Our
research addresses this gap and evaluates the applicability of six pretrained
backend models (MusicFM, Music2Vec, MERT, EncodecMAE, Jukebox, and MusiCNN) in
the context of MRS. We assess their performance using three recommendation
models: K-nearest neighbours (KNN), shallow neural network, and BERT4Rec. Our
findings suggest that pretrained audio representations exhibit significant
performance variability between traditional MIR tasks and MRS, indicating that
valuable aspects of musical information captured by backend models may differ
depending on the task. This study establishes a foundation for further
exploration of pretrained audio representations to enhance music recommendation
systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08987v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08987v1
The connection of polaritonic chemistry with the physics of a spin glass,"Polaritonic chemistry has garnered increasing attention in recent years due
to pioneering experimental results, which show that site- and bond-selective
chemistry at room temperature is achievable through strong collective coupling
to field fluctuations in optical cavities. Despite these notable experimental
strides, the underlying theoretical mechanisms remain unclear. In this focus
review, we highlight a fundamental theoretical link between the seemingly
unrelated fields of polaritonic chemistry and spin glasses, exploring its
profound implications for the theoretical framework of polaritonic chemistry.
Specifically, we present a mapping of the dressed electronic structure problem
under collective vibrational strong coupling to the iconic
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of spin glasses. This mapping uncovers a
collectively induced instability in the dressed electronic structure
(spontaneous replica symmetry breaking), which could provide the long-sought
seed for significant local chemical modifications in polaritonic chemistry.
This mapping paves the way to incorporate, adjust and probe numerous spin glass
concepts in polaritonic chemistry, such as frustration, aging dynamics, excess
of thermal fluctuations, time-reversal symmetry breaking or stochastic
resonances. Ultimately, the mapping also offers fresh insights into the
applicability of spin glass theory beyond condensed matter systems and it
suggests novel theoretical directions such as polarization glasses with
explicitly time-dependent order parameter functions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08986v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08986v1
Clean Label Attacks against SLU Systems,"Poisoning backdoor attacks involve an adversary manipulating the training
data to induce certain behaviors in the victim model by inserting a trigger in
the signal at inference time. We adapted clean label backdoor (CLBD)-data
poisoning attacks, which do not modify the training labels, on state-of-the-art
speech recognition models that support/perform a Spoken Language Understanding
task, achieving 99.8% attack success rate by poisoning 10% of the training
data. We analyzed how varying the signal-strength of the poison, percent of
samples poisoned, and choice of trigger impact the attack. We also found that
CLBD attacks are most successful when applied to training samples that are
inherently hard for a proxy model. Using this strategy, we achieved an attack
success rate of 99.3% by poisoning a meager 1.5% of the training data. Finally,
we applied two previously developed defenses against gradient-based attacks,
and found that they attain mixed success against poisoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08985v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08985v1
