      "Summary: Multibody dynamics simulation plays an important role in various fields,\n",
      "including mechanical engineering, robotics, and biomechanics. Setting up\n",
      "computational models however becomes increasingly challenging as systems grow\n",
      "in size and complexity. Especially the consistent combination of models across\n",
      "different physical domains usually demands a lot of attention. This motivates\n",
      "us to study formal languages for compositional modeling of multiphysical\n",
      "systems. This article shows how multibody systems, or more precisely assemblies\n",
      "of rigid bodies connected by lower kinematic pairs, fit into the framework of\n",
      "Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems (EPHS). This approach is based on the\n",
      "hierarchical decomposition of systems into their ultimately primitive\n",
      "components, using a simple graphical syntax. Thereby, cognitive load can be\n",
      "reduced and communication is facilitated, even with non-experts. Moreover, the\n",
      "encapsulation and reuse of subsystems promotes efficient model development and\n",
      "management. In contrast to established modeling languages such as Modelica, the\n",
      "primitive components of EPHS are not defined by arbitrary equations. Instead,\n",
      "there are four kinds of components, each defined by a particular geometric\n",
      "structure with a clear physical interpretation. This higher-level approach\n",
