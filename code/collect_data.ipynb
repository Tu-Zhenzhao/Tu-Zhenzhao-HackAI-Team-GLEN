      "in size and complexity. Especially the consistent combination of models across\n",
      "different physical domains usually demands a lot of attention. This motivates\n",
      "us to study formal languages for compositional modeling of multiphysical\n",

      "of rigid bodies connected by lower kinematic pairs, fit into the framework of\n",
      "Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems (EPHS). This approach is based on the\n",
